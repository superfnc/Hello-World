# Hello-World
Just want to say hello-world

I want to improve my capability of promgramming by using this website, and I come from a very declined industry. By learning python, I find I like programming in some extent. I think the future will be a nice place to live because of the development of computer and AI technology. The tide of Intelligent manufacturing is hitting our thoughts and life style. Therefore, whether I change my working in the future or not, I want to learn more knowledge about programming, and this place is so helpful, after it was bought by MicroSoft recently. So, let's just do it, without asking too many questions about prospect.
